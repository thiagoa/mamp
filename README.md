# mamp

Web development with Apache, PHP and MySQL on OS X. This app will be an alternative for all-in-one packages such as XAMPP,
favoring software that's already installed on you system, and kick-ass package managers such as Homebrew. Boring tasks
like adding virtual hosts on Apache will be a breeze.

This app aims to provide an unified command line interface for the following tasks:

- Setup a LAMP development environment on OS X on the command line. Automate the process on your workstations.
- Start/stop/restart/etc Apache and MySQL. Default versions are: OS X's native Apache and Homebrew's MySQL and PHP.
- Easily create and edit apache vhosts on any folder you wish
- Change PHP version on the fly
- Manually edit your created vhosts
